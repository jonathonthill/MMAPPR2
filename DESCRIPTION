Description: MMAPPR2 maps mutations resulting from pooled RNA-seq data from the F2
    cross of forward genetic screens. Its predecessor is described in a paper published
    in Genome Research (Hill et al. 2013). MMAPPR2 accepts aligned BAM files as well as
    a reference genome as input, identifies loci of high sequence disparity between the
    control and mutant RNA sequences, predicts variant effects using Ensembl's Variant
    Effect Predictor, and outputs a ranked list of candidate mutations.
